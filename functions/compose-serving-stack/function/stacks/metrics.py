"""What Modelplane calls each metric the components it installs emit.

Reviewed, pinned data, the same discipline as the component lists. A
MetricMapping is the extension point for a component Modelplane ships no
statements for; these are the ones it does.

Renaming is only safe where the measurements agree. SGLang's
inter_token_latency is not vLLM's time per output token, so neither is
renamed onto a shared name and the gateway supplies that measurement for
both. A histogram is renamed only where its bucket boundaries match, which is
why SGLang's latency histograms are absent here: they resolve to a hundred
milliseconds where vLLM's resolve to one, and a quantile across the two is
wrong rather than approximate.

Matching has to hold across the fleet, not just between two engines, because
a query sums buckets by boundary and a series with different boundaries
corrupts the sum for everyone. So each modelplane_* histogram has
exactly one source. The engines' token histograms can't meet that even alone:
vLLM sizes their buckets from --max-model-len, so two vLLM deployments
disagree. They leave as counters instead, a sum and a count having no buckets.

docs/utils/validate/validate_manifests.py holds every recipe's engine to the
versions and flags these mappings need, so a change to one changes both.
